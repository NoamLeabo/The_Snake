🐍 The Snake Game - OOP Java Edition
Welcome to The Snake Game, a fun and classic game built in Java that explores and practices the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation to create a fully interactive Snake game with a graphical user interface.




🎮 Game Features
Simple Snake gameplay: Control the snake to eat the apples and grow longer. Try not to crash into the walls or the snake itself.
Score tracking: Keep track of your score with each apple eaten.
Restart and reset options: After the game ends, you can restart or reset the best score.
Best Score memory: The game saves your highest score during the session.
Smooth animations and a polished UI: Clean, bright, and fun design using custom-drawn elements.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language
Swing & AWT: For rendering the graphical interface and game window
OOP Concepts: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are central to the design.
🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.

Download the GAME.jar file from the repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the GAME.jar file.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
java -jar GAME.jar
The game window should open, and you can start playing!

🕹️ Controls
Arrow keys - Control the snake's direction.
Start - Click on the "Start" button from the main screen to begin the game.
End Game - Quit the game after losing or at any point in the Game Over screen.
Restart - Start a new game from the Game Over screen.
Reset Score - Clear the high score.

🧑‍💻 Project Structure
src/: Contains the Java source code for the game.
images/: Stores custom game assets like the snake and apple images.
GAME.jar: The executable JAR file that launches the game.
💡 Key OOP Concepts Explored
Encapsulation: All game components (snake, apple, game panel) are encapsulated into separate classes to ensure modularity and readability.
Inheritance: Game objects share common properties through inheritance.
Polymorphism: Multiple behaviors (like movement, collision detection) are implemented using polymorphism in the snake's movements.
Abstraction: The game’s logic is abstracted away from the graphical representation to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.
