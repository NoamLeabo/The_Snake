# 🐍 The Snake Game - OOP Java Edition

Welcome to **The Snake Game**, a fun and classic game built in Java that explores and practices the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project demonstrates the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation to create a fully interactive Snake game with a graphical user interface.


## 🎮 Game Features

- **Simple Snake gameplay:** Control the snake to eat the apples and grow longer. Try not to crash into the walls or the snake itself.
- **Score tracking:** Keep track of your score with each apple eaten.
- **Restart and reset options:** After the game ends, you can restart or reset the best score.
- **Best Score memory:** The game saves your highest score during the session.
- **Smooth animations and a polished UI:** Clean, bright, and fun design using custom-drawn elements.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language
- **Swing & AWT:** For rendering the graphical interface and game window
- **OOP Concepts:** Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are central to the design.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java JDK 8** or higher installed on your system.
2. Download the **GAME.jar** file from the repository
3. You can now simply click on the download file anf play! 
4. Another option - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the **GAME.jar** file.
5. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar GAME.jar
6. The game window should open, and you can start playing!

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Arrow keys** - Control the snake's direction.
- **Start** - Click on the "Start" button from the main screen to begin the game.
- **End Game** - Quit the game after losing or at any point in the Game Over screen.
- **Restart** - Start a new game from the Game Over screen.
- **Reset Score** - Clear the high score.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the Java source code for the game.
- **images/**: Stores custom game assets like the snake and apple images.
- **GAME.jar**: The executable JAR file that launches the game.

## 💡 Key OOP Concepts Explored
- **Encapsulation:** All game components (snake, apple, game panel) are encapsulated into separate classes to ensure modularity and readability.
- **Inheritance:** Game objects share common properties through inheritance.
- **Polymorphism:** Multiple behaviors (like movement, collision detection) are implemented using polymorphism in the snake's movements.
- **Abstraction:** The game’s logic is abstracted away from the graphical representation to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

## 🙌 Notes
- **Graphics:** Hand-drawn custom assets.
- **Development Tools:** Java, Swing, IntelliJ IDEA

## 🚧 Future Improvements
- Add more difficulty levels.
- Implement snake skins and different themes.
- Add sound effects for a richer gaming experience.

Enjoy playing The Snake! 🐍🍎
